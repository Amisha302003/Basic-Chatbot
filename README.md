# Basic-Chatbot
It is the basic chatbot where you can chat.
There is only few questions because it is a basic chatbot.
In this it will show you some questions in which you have to enter the number which would you like to talk about.
After every question this will ask you if you have any question that would you like to talk about if yes, then it will show you the options again. If not then it will close the chatbot.
And if you enter something which is not in the code it say sorry, i didn't understand what are you saying. And ask you again if you would like to talk.
